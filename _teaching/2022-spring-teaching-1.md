My most favorite class as a Teaching Assistant at UC Santa Barbara. Introduction to Data Science [Link](https://cs.ucsb.edu/education/courses/course-descriptions/introduction-data-science-1) is an introductory Data Science course offered by Computer Science department open for even outside majors who wish to get started with Data Science and Statistics. It comprises of basic programming concepts in Python like foundational programming concepts, problem-solving strategies and code design, and data science concepts as table operations, exploratory data analysis, basic probability. I have worked with Professor Sharon Solis for this course who is an amazing mentor and instructor. I have consistently TAed for this course 4 times. 

**My Duties**

Mentored over 30 students as a TA and performed activities like conducting labs preparing quizzes, organizing office hours, grading assignments, answering the questions in class forums, etc. Each TA is assigned over 30 students and we are responsible to organize labs, office hours and one on one sessions for these 30 students.
