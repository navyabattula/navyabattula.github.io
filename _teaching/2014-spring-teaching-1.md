My first class as a Teaching Assistant at UC Santa Barbara. Introduction to Computer Science [Link](https://cs.ucsb.edu/education/courses/course-descriptions/introduction-computer-science) is an introductory programming course offered by Computer Science department open for even outside majors who wish to experience coding as a subject. It comprises of basic programming concepts in Python that is sufficient to give the learner a basic knowledge of programming syntax and core concepts to get started. I have TAed for this class under Professor Yekaterina Kharitanova along with 7 other TAs.
