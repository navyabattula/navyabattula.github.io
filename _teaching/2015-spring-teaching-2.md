Computer Architecture CS154 [Link](https://cs.ucsb.edu/education/courses/course-descriptions/computer-architecture) is one of the foundational course in Computer Science that is part of every curriculum. It comprises of concepts of architecture of various components of a computer like CPU, memory, I/O etc. I have TAed for this class under Professor Ziad Matni along with 4 other TAs. 

**My Duties**

Mentored over 30 students as a TA and performed activities like conducting labs preparing quizzes, organizing office hours, grading assignments, answering the questions in class forums, proctoring exams etc. Each TA is assigned over 30 students and we are responsible to organize labs, office hours and one on one sessions for these 30 students.
