Hello 👋🏻 everyone! Welcome to my personal webpage! A little bit about me - I am an **AI Engineer** obsessed with solving problems that lie at the bleeding edge of technology. Over the past two years, I’ve bridged the gap between theoretical research and real-world impact, working on everything from **Generative AI chatbots** that understand the business context to building **Intelligent systems** that transform data into actionable insights and seamless user experiences. My work isn’t just about code—it’s about creating tools that learn, adapt, and empower.

My expertise lies in Natural Language Processing (NLP), where I’ve developed and deployed state-of-the-art AI solutions. From **fine-tuning GPT and BERT models** to powering **content recommendation systems with Pinecone VectorDB**, I’ve driven a **40% increase in user engagement** by crafting personalized, AI-driven experiences. I’ve also built **multi-modal AI assistants integrating OpenAI GPT and Anthropic Claude**, revolutionizing customer support with a **60% boost in efficiency**.

In the realm of Computer Vision, I’ve designed OpenCV-based modules for real-time environmental analysis, **leveraging depth information and color channel operations** to detect and classify objects with precision. My work spans from **robotics applications to medical imaging**, where I developed a **CNN-based framework for diagnosing Diabetic Retinopathy with 96% accuracy, even under noisy conditions**.

I thrive on solving complex problems, whether it’s **optimizing LLM inference pipelines on AWS SageMaker** to reduce latency by 35% or architecting scalable data processing frameworks like **PERRY for networking data**. My research contributions, including publications on **foundation models for network security [netFound]** and **low-latency communication [Optimal Paramater Estimation]**, reflect my commitment to advancing AI’s frontiers.

When I’m not building AI systems, you will find me exploring the latest in **Open Source Gen AI and LLM based applications/frameworks**, or exploring a new side project on how I optimize things using **AI Agents**. I believe in the power of AI to reshape industries, and I’m here to make that future a reality—one algorithm at a time.

Let’s connect and create something extraordinary.

*“The best AI doesn’t just process data—it understands context. Let’s teach machines to see the world as we do.”*
