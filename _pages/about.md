Hello 👋🏻 everyone! Welcome to my personal webpage! A little bit about me - I am an **AI Engineer** with a passion for pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with cutting-edge technologies. With **1.5 years of hands-on experience in Generative AI, Deep Learning, and Large Language Models (LLMs)**, I specialize in building intelligent systems that transform data into actionable insights and seamless user experiences.

My expertise lies in Natural Language Processing (NLP), where I’ve developed and deployed state-of-the-art AI solutions. From **fine-tuning GPT and BERT models** to powering **content recommendation systems with Pinecone VectorDB**, I’ve driven a **40% increase in user engagement** by crafting personalized, AI-driven experiences. I’ve also built **multi-modal AI assistants integrating OpenAI GPT and Anthropic Claude**, revolutionizing customer support with a **60% boost in efficiency**.

In the realm of Computer Vision, I’ve designed OpenCV-based modules for real-time environmental analysis, **leveraging depth information and color channel operations** to detect and classify objects with precision. My work spans from **robotics applications to medical imaging**, where I developed a **CNN-based framework for diagnosing Diabetic Retinopathy with 96% accuracy, even under noisy conditions**.

I thrive on solving complex problems, whether it’s **optimizing LLM inference pipelines on AWS SageMaker** to reduce latency by 35% or architecting scalable data processing frameworks like **PERRY for networking data**. My research contributions, including publications on **foundation models for network security [netFound]** and low-latency communication, reflect my commitment to advancing AI’s frontiers.

When I’m not building AI systems, I’m exploring the latest in **LangChain, LlamaIndex, and open-source LLMs like Llama 2 and Gemma**, or exploring a new side project on how I optimize things using **AI Agents**. I believe in the power of AI to reshape industries, and I’m here to make that future a reality—one algorithm at a time.

Let’s connect and create something extraordinary.
