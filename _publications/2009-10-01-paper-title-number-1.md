PERRY is my masters thesis dissertation in which I discuss the prevailing issue of tight coupling between data processing and
model training parts in Machine learning for networking pipelines and then try to address this problem with a flexible and
scalable data processing framework called PERRY. Leveraging state of the art tools and being scalable with limited resources
makes our framework an easy to use solution for networking researchers.
