Worked under the supervision of Professor P. Vijay Kumar of Indian Institute of Science. The project titled Optimal Parameter Estimation for achieving Low Latency and Reliable Communication using Deep Neural Nets is a research module that I have completed while working as Summer Research Fellow at Indian Institute of Science. It involves generating the random values for emission and transmission probabilities in python and using them along with the sim2net package in python to generate packet drop statistics. A dataset constructed from these values can be used to train the deep neural network in generating the transmission and emission values approximately based on only those packet drop statistics efficiently.
