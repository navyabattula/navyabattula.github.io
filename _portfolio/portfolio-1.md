Developed an AI-powered customer support chatbot using Streamlit that seamlessly connects to an SQL database to retrieve and provide real-time sales data to users. The chatbot leverages LangChain and open source LLMs like Llama and Gemma for natural language processing, enabling customers to query sales records with ease. The solution integrates Pandas to format and display
query results in a structured, tabular form, ensuring clear and accurate information delivery. Implemented caching mechanisms
to optimize database interactions and improve performance. The system also features robust error handling and fallback methods, ensuring a smooth user experience. This chatbot significantly enhances customer support operations by allowing agents and users to quickly access critical data without manual intervention.
